# Weather Predictor
Weather predictor is a simple web based interface or software that provides user the facility to view the weather of any city around the world for one week. It uses 2 api's for this purpose-
1. Google Maps api
2. forecast.io api
#Modules
There are basically two modules currentely. Both modules are made for the user to enhance the features of the weather system. We are adding some more features too but it will require some time.
The first module is the login module for user. If the user has an account, he/she can directly login with credentials and view his previously saved locations.
In the second module a functionality is provided by the team where the user can view the weather details of next seven days/weeks.
